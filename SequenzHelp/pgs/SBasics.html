	<h1>Sequenz Basics</h1>
	<p>
	Sequenz is a simple and easy to use webcam application. It takes pictures with your iSight camera with a selectable
	time interval and uploads them to your FTP server. It supports secure FTP connections over TLS/SSL.
	</p>
	<p>
	To get started, fill out the FTP server values, like server address, user name, password and path on the server. 
	You can set the default image filename to any name you want. It will be uploaded with an extension ".jpg" in jpeg file format.
	The file dimension is 640x480 pixel.
	</p>
	<p>
	After all FTP information is present, start the recording either by clicking the menu "File" > "Record", pressing "Command + R" as shortcut or pressing the
	record button in the main window. To stop the recording, simply press the record button again.
	</p>
	<p>
	Sequenz is freeware. If you like Sequenz and want to support its future development, please <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&business=dom@gwosdek.net&item_name=Sequenz&no_shipping=1&cn=Comments&tax=0&currency_code=EUR&lc=US">donate via PayPal</a>.
